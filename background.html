        <h2>Background of Kolej Vokasional Ipoh</h2>

        <p>
          Kolej Vokasional Ipoh (KV Ipoh) has a rich history that dates back to 1930 when it was first established as the Government Trade School. Its primary purpose was to train technical workers for the Federated Malay States Railway Workshop. Over the years, the institution underwent several transformations in line with national education and industrial needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1950, it was upgraded to the Junior Technical Trade School, offering training in mechanical, electrical, carpentry, masonry, and welding fields. By 1963, it evolved into a Secondary Trade School, introducing additional programs such as automotive and radio/TV servicing, with English as the medium of instruction.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1968, the school became Sekolah Menengah Vokasional Ipoh, offering vocational and skills-based education with certifications such as the Malaysian Vocational Certificate (SVM) and Malaysian Skills Certificate (SKM). This was followed by another upgrade in 1997, where it became Sekolah Menengah Teknik Lebuh Cator, expanding its offerings to include technical, vocational, commerce, and skills training.
        </p>

        <p>
          The transformation into a full-fledged vocational college began in 2011, when the institution was known as Sekolah Menengah Vokasional Lebuh Cator. In 2012, it reverted to the name Sekolah Menengah Vokasional Ipoh before being officially upgraded to Kolej Vokasional Ipoh in 2013. The first intake under this new status began in 2014, with 118 students enrolled across four diploma programs: Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Technology, Computer Systems & Networking, Banking, and Marketing. In 2015, the Construction Technology program was added to further strengthen the college’s offerings.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, Kolej Vokasional Ipoh offers a dual certification pathway: a two-year Malaysian Vocational Certificate (SVM) followed by a 2½-year Malaysian Vocational Diploma (DVM). The current diploma programs include Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Technology, Computer Systems & Networking, Marketing, Banking, and Construction Technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          Located on Persiaran Brash in Ipoh, Perak, the campus spans approximately 25.35 acres and is equipped with comprehensive facilities such as workshops, computer labs, dormitories, a multipurpose hall, and sports amenities. The college accommodates around 300 to 360 students annually and continues to play a vital role in supplying skilled, job-ready graduates to meet the demands of local and national industries.
        </p>

        <p>
          With its vision of becoming a leader in excellent Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), KV Ipoh is committed to delivering quality education that is practical, industry-relevant, and forward-thinking. The college’s mission centers on enhancing the quality of vocational training through the implementation of high-standard programs, equipping students with both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience.
